\section*{1}

Suppose that $G$ is a finite group with an element $g$ of order 5 and an element $h$ of order 7. Why must $|G| \geq 35$.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Recall Corollary 6.6: Suppose that $G$ is a finite group and $g \in G$. Then the order of $g$ must divide the number of elements in $G$. Thus $|G|$ must be divisible by 5 and by 7. The smallest such positive integer that has this property is 35. This proves that $|G| \geq 35$.


\section*{2}

Suppose that $G$ is a finite group with 60 elements. What are the orders of possible subgroups of $G$?

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The possible orders of subgroups of $G$ are the divisors of $G$: 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60.


\section*{4}

Prove or disprove: Every subgroup of the integers has finite order.

\vspace*{\baselineskip}

This statement is false. Consider the group $2\mathbb{Z} = \{ ..., -2, 0, 2, ... \}$. Note that $0 \in 2\mathbb{Z}$. Note that since the sum of two even numbers is even that $2\mathbb{Z}$ is closed. Notice that if $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ is even then $-x$ is even as well, this proves that all inverses are in $\mathbb{Z}$. This proves that $2\mathbb{Z}$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ with infinite order.
